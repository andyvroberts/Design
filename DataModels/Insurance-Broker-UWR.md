## Insurance Broker view of Underwriting - CDM
The conceptual data model acts as a concept map, describing how a Broker organisation views and understands Underwriting in the context of its own counterparty relationships and high-level business processes.  

This data model was created using Information Engineering (IE) notation and follows its conventions for relationships and phrases.

### Relationship Phrases
Business rules, conditions or objectives can be represented by a conceptual data model. Within this model, relationships can be verbally stated by expansion of the phrases placed on the relationship lines.  
IE notation only expresses single direction phrasing, but a *reverse phrase* has been added for completeness in the table below.

### Data Entity Definitions
Descriptions of Data Entities in a conceptual model are essential to provide meaning and context.  
  
|Entity|Meaning|Synonyms|
|:-|:-|-:|
|Accounts|Within a large Broker organisation, and at a high-level, an *Account* is created for each Facility (or Binding Authority). Premium and other Transactional data is aggregated within the Account.  In addition to Facility, Accounts may be created for each *Business Line* and also for each *Sub/Cover-Holder*. One of many Accounting objectives is the identification of profit or loss for each *Accounting Entity*.<br/>For Transactional Model Accounts, items are booked at an individual Policy or Facility entity, and calculated Daily.<br/>For Delegated Model Accounts, items are booked at the Sub Cover-Holder entity and calculated Monthly.<br/>Bespoke Insurance accounting Terms include:<br/> 1. Gross - the Sub/Cover-Holder collects Premiums from the insured.<br/>2. Gross Net - the Sub/Cover-Holder deducts their own commission and/or expenses.<br/>3. Gross Net Net - the Sub/Cover-Holder deducts thrid party (pay-away) commission and/or expenses.  This is the value passed to the Carrier. |Accounting|
|Binding Authority|A legal agreement between the Carrier and the Cover-Holder, or the Cover-Holder and the Sub Cover-Holder.<br/>The authority is specific to circumstances and defines the products, limits, territories, referral criteria, regulations, levels of assumed risk and/or the split between Carriers for any underwritten Policy. The Carrier holds the risk and must pay-out following a valid Claim.<br/>The term *"Binding Authority"* is the name given to this agreement where the Carrier is in the London Market.|Facility,<br/>Binder|
|BDX Sheet|The general term given to the spreadsheet representing the data content of a Bordereaux.  The sheet can either be a standardised layout or whatever the Sub/Cover-Holder is able to provide.<br/>Each sheet usually covers all new Monthly activity.  However, some Sub/Cover-Holders will provide all data history (inception to-date) in each latest BDX file.||
|Bordereaux|A method for provding data and information to third parties such as Carriers and TPA's.  Any Cover-Holder that has written business will produce at least 3 types of monthly datasets:<br/> - Risk Data (usually at Policy and/or Coverage level).<br/> - Premium Data.<br/> - Claim Data.|BDX|
|Broker|The organisational entity that is present at the point of sale of a Policy.  A Broker can also give advice and should be able to provide appropriate choices for required Coverages.<br/>Brokers enter the Policy details into a System or on paper.  They are usually either independant individuals/teams and specialise within a particular Market.|(Sub) Cover-Holder,<br/>Consortium|
|Business Distribution|The organisational entity where activities such as Policy Binding, issuing Documentation, and performing Policy administration is accomplished.<br/>Business Distribution is either internal to the receiving Cover-Holder (the Transactional Model) or delegated to a third party Sub Cover-Holder (the Delegated Model).||
|Business Division|A grouping of related business teams, usually arbitrary according to the structure of the Broker organisation.  Exmaples are<br/>Non-Volume Division: Commercial Combined (property) / Commercial (property) / Real-Estate.<br/>Volume Division: Non-Standard Property / High-risk (ccj, convictions, etc).<br/>Specialty Division: Latin American plant & machinery / International Liability / US Property / FINPRO.||
|Business Team|A specialist team with a Business Division.  The team can play the role of Underwriter, Cover-Holder and Administrator for lines of business.<br/>For example, a FINPRO Business Team will contain Underwriting expertise within the PI (Professional Indemnity) and D&O (Directors and Officers) lines.  A Commercial team may specialise in insurance products for Commerical Properties and a Real-Estate team may do the same for non-Commercial.||
|Capacity Agreement|Occurs between the Carrier and the Underwriter to set financial risk limits for binding Policies. These are specific to the financial capacity of a Carrier, and may exist as a component within other agreements such as a Binding Authority.|Binding Authority|
|Carrier|The legal entity or organisation that holds the Risk (has the Capacity) for an insurance policy.  The Carrier must pay out after a successful Claim.  Each Carrier assesses the performance of the Underwriters through the Loss Ratio.  Bonus values may be paid to Underwriters (Brokers / Cover-Holders) who produce a lower then expected Loss ratio.|Partner,<br/>Insurer,<br/>Market,<br/>Consortium|
|Claim|A Claim is the financial compensation that can be paid out according to the terms of the Policy.  The Claim may be subject to *Limits, Excesses or Deductibles* which can reduce the paid out total.  Some Claims can be paid to multiple payee's and may also occur as a sequence of transactions.<br/>In some specialty products, once a Policy has been *exhausted* (the maximum has been paid) it can be *reinstated* by paying more Premiums, after which, newly occuring Claims may be made.||
|Consortium|A Consortium (arrangement) is the name given to the method of Underwriting similar to a *Subscription*, but for the Composite Market (non-Lloyds).  Consortium arrangements are more likely to be used by Sub Cover-Holders.<br/>For example, a Sub Cover-Holder may *place* 50% of an insurance with an internal Business Team, and then place the remaining 50% by *going to market*.<br/>For the Sub Cover-Holder this represents a 50% *"line on the business"* and the size of this split is often pre-determined by the Binding Authority with the Carrier.  The 50% not covered is not on the internal books and will remain an unknown risk within internal systems and processes.  Any Premiums received will be related to only that 50% of the Cover.<br/>Consortium arrangements usually have one Underwriter who is the *Lead* and is responsible for decision making. The Lead does not have to obtain the largest percentage of cover.|Composite|
|Cover-Holder|The Cover-Holder acts as the agent of the insurance partner (the Carrier), who *"delegates authority"* and responsibility for the underwriting to the Cover-Holder.  Usually, the Cover-Holder provides either the processing volume or market specific expertise to Carriers, who do not have the organisational resources, but do have the financial Capacity.<br/>The Cover-Holder may act as an intermediary between the Carrier and the Sub Cover-Holders/Brokers.<br/>Usually a Cover-Holder is within an organisation which is also a Broker *and* one or more specialised Sub Cover-Holders.  Therefore, it is often important to understand the internal or external processing responsibilities defined by the Business Distrubution model.|Agent,<br/>MGA|
|Declaration|A line on a Subscription Slip from a Lloyds-backed Cover-Holder.  It identifies a specific risk in terms of the item being insured and also has an identified maximum loss value.  The Declaration may often be for the entire insured risk, irrespective of the percentage splits for written lines.<br/>Within the Composite Market (non-Lloyds) a Declaration is known as a *Risk*.|Risk|
|Delegated Model|The Delegated Business Distribution Model outsources certain business processes to other organisations.  All resulting processes are undertaken by third parties, and information flow must be obtained through the use of the Bordereaux mechanism.<br/>Carriers *delegate authority to Cover-Holders, who then delegate authority to Sub Cover-Holders*.  The Sub Cover-Holder Underwriters bind the Policy and issue Documentation.  The Cover-Holder usaully selectively monitors some activities of the Sub Cover-Holder.|MGU<br/>Model|
|Endorsement|Any change to an active Policy, including changes to Policy terms, customer details, financial values or payments.<br/>Some mid-term adjustments to a Policy may trigger business processes.  Examples are: adjust premium, re-calculate acquisition costs, or re-calculate exposures.|MTA|
|Insured|The Insured is the party who is the beneficiary of an insurance Policy.  In some cases (e.g. life assurance) the Insured may not be the same party that was involved in the purchase.|Policy Holder,<br/>Beneficiary|
|Loss Ratio|Dividing all relevent Policy Premiums by the Claims creates a ratio which indicates the overall profitability of specific business lines and product categories.<br/>Any ratio over 100% means a financial loss and indicates some business may not be viable.||
|Policy|An agreement for an insurance that is sold to a customer (the Insured) by a Broker, and underwritten by the Cover-Holder.  The Underwriting terms and conditions must meet the criteria of the Binding Authority.<br/>Some policies have multiple *sum insured* values as a Policy can encompass many Coverages.|Risk,<br/>Cover|
|Policy Document|The official set of Policy Documents detailing the terms and conditions of the Insurance agreement between the Carrier and the Insured.  These must be generated by the Cover-Holder as deemed responsible by the Business Distribution Model.  Where possible, documents are always electronic. ||
|Rating Factor|Each insurance product will have a structured assessment of its risks.  For example, life assurance has rating factors of age, health and occupation.  General insurance Rating Factors always depend on the insured entity.<br/>A sliding scale within Actuarial tables is used to generate the applicable rating factors for each risk.  The value of a rating factor is numeric, indicating a positive or negative adjustment within the overall Rating Guide.||
|Rating Guide|Created through the combination and interpretation of Rating Factors, the guide is used by the Cover-Holder to assess the amount of Policy Premiums that are charged to the Insured.  If the guide indicates higher risk then Premiums will be adjusted upwards.||
|Revenue Target|In one scenario, an Underwriting/business team within a Business Division will earn commission for every Policy which is placed through a Sub Cover-Holder.  This commission is the Revenue Target, set at Monthly or Yearly periods.<br/>Revenue Targets can be set at both Product (or *Business Class*) and Regional levels.|Plan|
|Subscription|The Subscription Market (Lloyds only) is the name given to the method of Underwriting which is also described by the *Consortium* entity above.  It functions in the same way, using percentage splits. Lloyds Subscriptions are more likely to be used by Cover-Holders.<br/>The splits are determined by agreement between Brokers, using *subscription slips* (or line slips) which are generated by the Broker submissions prior to Binding. Accepted subscriptions must fall within the Parameters of Binding Authorities.<br/>The Lloyds Subscription Market is the standard model for larger specialist insurance items that are *Transactional*.<br/>Once the Subscription slip is agreed upon, it is said to contain a *Signed Line* entry.|Line Slip|
|Sub Cover-Holder|The customer facing counterparty who sells products. This may be a high-street Broker, a national Broker or a group sales division within an organisation.  A Sub Cover-Holder *"takes the product to market"*. <br/>If the Sub Cover-Holder is a Broker then they will have access to multiple markets so as to provide options and choices.<br/>The Sub Cover-Holder obtains quotes which may turn into a sale (new business) if taken up.  That product is *"written"* by the insurance process known as Binding.|Broker,<br/>Sub-Agent|
|TPA|A Third Party Administrator is responsible for processing and handling of any claims on behalf of the underwriters and Sub/Cover-Holders. Within a large Broker organisation, there may be in-house TPA's.||
|Transactional Model|The Transactional Business Distribution Model retains all business processes internally within the parent organisation.  This model is usually applicable to higher/large value items from the Lloyds market.  All resulting processing and information flow are retained within internal systems.<br/>Carriers *delegate authority to the Cover-Holders*, who utilse their own Underwriting teams to perform Policy Binding and issue Documentation.|MGA<br/>Model|
|UMR|A Unique Market Reference is assigned to the Binding Authority as allocated by the Lloyd's Market. It usually includes a reference to the Broker and Policy number.  Within a Broker, the UMR is used for Accounting purposes and it identifies:<br/> - The Facility (binding authority).<br/> - The accounting year.<br/> - The Broker (Sub/Cover-Holder).<br/>During Sub/Cover-Holder registration, formal agreements are made regarding the settlement of accounts (e.g. commission and premium splits), at which time a UMR will be assigned.  That UMR must be included in any future Bordereaux details for every related Policy and Transaction.  Sometimes, a Cover-Holder may want to split their business for Accounting reasons and they can enter into many UMR agreements (although this incurrs additional costs).<br/>In settlement systems, the UMR can act as the account reference.  Monthly accounting submissions can be aggregated by using the UMR.||
